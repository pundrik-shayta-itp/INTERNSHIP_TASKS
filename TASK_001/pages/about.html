            <p>My name is Pundrik as you see on home page. I am a 4th year student of computer science and engineering from NIRMA UNIVERSITY and currently doing my Internship at Intuitive.Ai as SDE. I like competition so I play volleyball, cricket, table tennis etc. As competition is one of my favorite thing so in my coding journey i do competitive programming. I am a <b>SPECIALIST</b> on <a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/Pundrik">Codeforces</a> which is a competitive programming platform. I have solved over 1200 problems on various platforms like codeforces, leetcode, cses, geeks for geeks , coding ninjas. And I am looking forward to become an EXPERT on codeforces in upcoming months. I recently recieved <b><i>682nd</i></b> rank in <a href="https://iicpc.com/">IICPC2026</a> out of 13800 participants.  And ya that's me, other things i will figureout later.</p>
